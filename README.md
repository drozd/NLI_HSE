NLI is the task of predicting an author’s first language (L1) using only their writings in a second language (L2)

I used ETS Corpus of Non-Native Written English (12,000 essays). Dataset contains essays of 11 different language speakers. I used machine learning methods (SVM) to determine which group an author’s native language belongs to. By training models with different feature and parameter settings, we were able to reach an accuracy of 84%.
